## Pop-Up
This simple pop-up application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It features a responsive "Submit" button that triggers a pop-up window upon being clicked.
The pop-up contains a message confirming the successful submission of details.

## Key Features:
Responsive Design: The application is optimized for mobile devices, ensuring that the layout adjusts based on screen size.
Interactive Pop-Up: Clicking the "Submit" button triggers a pop-up window with a confirmation message and an image. Users can close the pop-up by clicking the "OK" button.
JavaScript Functionality: Two JavaScript functions (openPopup and closePopup) handle the display of the pop-up, adding and removing the open-popup class to show or hide the message.

## How It Works:
The HTML structure includes a container with a "Submit" button and the hidden pop-up window (popup div).
The openPopup function is triggered when the "Submit" button is clicked, adding the open-popup class to display the pop-up.
The closePopup function is used to hide the pop-up when the "OK" button is clicked, removing the open-popup class.
